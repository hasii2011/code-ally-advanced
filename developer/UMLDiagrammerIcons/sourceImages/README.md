These icons are the converted .jpg icons that I received from the contractor.  I received .png icons but they were sized at 512.16 x 512.16.   When I tried to size them to exactly 512x512, they sized to 511.15;  Then I realized that was in points not pixels.

The .png files were sized 2134x2134,   Not sure what happened but good for me.  The contractor was probably using a metric measurement.
